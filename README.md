## ⚠️ Disclaimer
> This tool is intended for educational and lawful investigative purposes only. Accessing or interacting with certain dark web content may be illegal depending on your jurisdiction. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this tool or the data gathered using it.
>
> Use responsibly and at your own risk. Ensure you comply with all relevant laws and institutional policies before conducting OSINT investigations.
>
> Additionally, Robin leverages third-party APIs (including LLMs). Be cautious when sending potentially sensitive queries, and review the terms of service for any API or model provider you use.

## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> The tool needs Tor to do the searches. You can install Tor using `apt install tor` on Linux/Windows(WSL) or `brew install tor` on Mac. Once installed, confirm if Tor is running in the background.

robin cli --model gpt-4.1 --query "ransomware payments"
```

### Docker Image (Web UI Mode)

- Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t robin .
```

- Run the Docker as:

```bash
docker run --rm \
   -v "$(pwd)/.env:/app/.env" \
   --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
   -p 8501:8501 \

```

### Using Python (Development Version)

- With `Python 3.10+` installed, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py -m gpt-4.1 -q "ransomware payments" -t 12
```

> [!TIP]
> You can provide OpenAI or Anthropic or Google API key by either creating .env file (refer to sample env file in the repo) or by setting env variables in PATH.
>
> For Ollama, provide `http://host.docker.internal:11434` as Ollama URL if running using docker image method or `http://127.0.0.1:11434` for other methods.

## Usage

```bash
Robin: AI-Powered Dark Web OSINT Tool

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit     
  --model {gpt4o,gpt-4.1,claude-3-5-sonnet-latest,llama3.1,gemini-2.5-flash,Custom}, -m {gpt4o,gpt-4.1,claude-3-5-sonnet-latest,llama3.1,gemini-2.5-flash,Custom}
                        Select LLM model (e.g., gpt4o, claude sonnet 3.5, ollama models, gemini 2.5 flash, or Custom for custom endpoints)
  --query QUERY, -q QUERY
                        Dark web search query
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                        Number of threads to use for scraping (Default: 5)
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Filename to save the final intelligence summary. If not provided, a filename based on the
                        current date and time is used.

Example commands:
 - robin -m gpt4o -q "ransomware payments" -t 12
 - robin --model claude-3-5-sonnet-latest --query "sensitive credentials exposure" --threads 8 --output filename
 - robin -m llama3.1 -q "zero days"
 - robin -m gemini-2.5-flash -q "zero days"
```
